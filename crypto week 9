Needham-Schroeder Protocol has 2 uses:
  Create communication between two entities within a domain.
  Single sign-on implementations.

Two passes:
  Secret key distibution with mutual authentication using public key cryptosystem + timestamps.

Three passes (same as above but uses digital signatures + nonce):  
  An alternative to using time-stamps is using a Nonce (a random number chosen by the verifier).
    Provides "freshness"
