# Meta-Data for Live Music

Final year project supervised by Sean Bechhofer, as part of COMP34100, and centered on meta-data for live music.

## Getting Started
I recommend using pip to automatically install any dependencies required by the application.

### Prerequisites
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)

### Python package dependencies:    
PyQt5    
geopy    
SPARQLWrapper    
pyaudio    
qtawesome    
matplotlib    
requests    

### Running the program
Clone the master branch, and within the directory:
```
python etreebrowser/__init__.py
```

## Running the tests
Tests are found in the /test/ folder, and are designed to be run with PyTest and PyQt.

## Built With

* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) - Graphical user interface framework.
* [eTree](http://etree.linkedmusic.org/) - Provides the data used within the project.
* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) - Used to generate geographical representations of meta-data.
* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used to generate visual representations of feature analyses.

## Versioning

This project is yet to reach a stable version and any use should be on the basis of expecting the occasionally blip.
